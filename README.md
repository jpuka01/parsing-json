## What was the most interesting part of this assignment?

I found the implementation of dynamic data handling using JSON and jQuery particularly interesting. Loading and filtering product categories dynamically was challenging but rewarding, as it deepened my understanding of this common but intricate task. Balancing functionality with a user-friendly interface made the experience even more valuable.
